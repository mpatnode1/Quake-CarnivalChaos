Heretic 1 Textures

By Raven Software, (c) Raven Software

Converted by Tronyn using the Doomtex program.

Notes:

These didn't convert awfully well to Quake, some work, some don't. This wad, in combination with Dilvish' wad which has
textures based on those from Heretic, and a bit of editing ability yourself, is what you need to make a truly Heretic-styled
level for Quake.
