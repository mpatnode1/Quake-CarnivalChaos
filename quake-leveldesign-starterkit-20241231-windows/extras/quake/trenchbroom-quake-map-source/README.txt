This directory contains id's original Quake levels, modified
ever-so-slightly to make them easy to load into TrenchBroom 2.

The original levels were taken from:

  https://rome.ro/news/2016/2/14/quake-map-sources-released

The WAD containing the textures used in the levels was taken
from:

  https://www.quaddicted.com/files/wads/quakewad.zip

The map files were automatically modified via a Python
script, which can be examined at `download_quake_map_source.py`.

For more details on how to use these maps, see
dumptruck_ds's "Mapping for Quake: TrenchBroom 2.0 -
The id Maps" tutorial:
