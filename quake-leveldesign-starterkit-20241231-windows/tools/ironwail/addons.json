Beyond Belief est l'un des premiers exemples de niveaux quasi professionnels engendrés par la scène Quake du milieu des années 90. Créé par Matthias Worch, Beyond Belief est un ensemble de huit niveaux qui aurait pu, déjà à l'époque de sa sortie, facilement constituer un cinquième épisode officiel. Éditer Quake dans ses premières heures était une gageure : la plupart des acteurs n'avaient simplement pas accès au matériel nécessaire pour faire tourner les outils d'origine, les éditeurs tiers étaient en flux constant, en plus d'être rudimentaires, et les fonctionnalités de base, comme la prévisualisation 3D ou l'ajustement des textures n'étaient pas disponibles. Tout devait être fait à la main en modifiant les cartes d'origine et vérifier le résultat nécessitait d'attendre la fin de processus de compilation extrêmement longs. Il aura fallu sept mois pour créer ce véritable testament du temps et de la frustration que demandait la perfection d'un tel épisode. Cela n'a toutefois pas empêché Beyond Belief de voir le jour durant la première année de sortie de Quake et de voir perdurer son héritage jusqu'à aujourd'hui : cet épisode est encore souvent mentionné par la communauté parmi les extensions incontournables. Cette sortie de Beyond Belief inclut également Beyond Belief 2008, une carte supplémentaire créée par Matthias Worch et Negke. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game bbelief”.

I livelli di Beyond Belief sono tra i primi esempi di produzione di calibro professionale da parte della community di Quake a metà degli anni 90. Beyond Belief è una serie di otto livelli creati da Matthias Worch che non avrebbe sfigurato affatto come quinto episodio ufficiale anche all'epoca della pubblicazione originaria. Modificare Quake agli albori era molto difficile: la gran parte dei giocatori non disponeva dell'hardware utilizzato per il funzionamento degli strumenti di sviluppo. Esisteva un flusso continuo di editor di terze parti che rimanevano primitivi, e non erano disponibili funzioni essenziali come l'anteprima 3D e l'allineamento delle texture: occorreva modificare manualmente le mappe originarie e sottostare a procedure di compilazione prolungate per verificare i risultati. Realizzato nell'arco di sette mesi, il mod è un'autentica testimonianza del tempo e della frustrazione richiesti per perfezionare un episodio in quel periodo. Tuttavia, ciò non impedì a Beyond Belief di essere pubblicato entro il primo anno dopo l'uscita di Quake e la sua eredità rimane tuttora tangibile: l'episodio viene spesso citato dalla community come uno degli add-on imprescindibili. La presente edizione di Beyond Belief include anche Beyond Belief 2008, un seguito creato da Matthias Worch e Negke. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game bbelief”.

„Beyond Belief“ ist eins der ersten Beispiele für das hohe Niveau der Kreationen, das die Quake-Szene Mitte der 90er Jahre an den Tag legte. „Beyond Belief“ von Matthias Worch besteht aus 8 Leveln, die (sogar bereits zum damaligen Release) als offizielle fünfte Episode herhalten könnten. Es war damals gar nicht mal so einfach, Fan-Inhalte für Quake zu erstellen, da die meisten Leute keinen Zugang zur nötigen Hardware für die ursprünglichen Tools hatten. Also hat man sich auf Editoren von Drittanbietern verlassen, die allerdings nicht ohne Ecken und Kanten waren. Grundlegende Features wie eine 3D-Vorschau oder das Anpassen von Texturen gab es nicht. Man musste die ursprünglichen Maps von Hand editieren, und wenn man das Ergebnis begutachten wollte, musste man erst warten, bis der lange Compiling-Prozess abgeschlossen war. „Beyond Belief“ entstand innerhalb von 7 Monaten und ist wahrlich ein Zeuge der Zeit und Geduld, die das Fertigstellen einer Episode damals kostete. Das hat den Schöpfer allerdings nicht davon abgehalten, das Add-on innerhalb des ersten Jahres nach Release von Quake herauszubringen – und es hält sich bis heute. Sie wird von vielen der Community als eines der wichtigsten Add-ons angesehen. Diese Release-Version von „Beyond Belief“ enthält außerdem „Beyond Belief 2008“, eine Nachfolger-Map von Matthias Worch und Negke. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game bbelief”.

Beyond Belief is one of the earliest examples of the professional caliber levels that would come out of the mid 90s Quake scene. Created by Matthias Worch, Beyond Belief is an eight level set that would've easily fit in as an official fifth episode, even at the time of its original release. Editing Quake in the early days was a challenge, with most people not having access to the hardware used to run the original tools. Third party editors were in constant flux and were primitive. Basic features such as 3d previews and adjusting textures were not available. All of this had to be done by hand editing the original maps, and sitting through a very long compile process to check your results. Created over the course of seven months, it truly is a testament to the time and frustration perfecting an episode would’ve taken back then. This didn't stop Beyond Belief from releasing within Quake’s first year of release, however, and its legacy lasts to this day; the episode is often brought up as one of the essential add-ons within the community. This release of Beyond Belief also includes Beyond Belief 2008, a sequel map created by Matthias Worch and Negke. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game bbelief”.

Beyond Belief es uno de los primeros ejemplos de niveles de calidad profesional que salieron de la escena de Quake a mediados de los noventa. Fue creado por Matthias Worch y es un conjunto de ocho niveles que bien podría haber sido el quinto episodio oficial, incluso en el momento de su lanzamiento original. Editar Quake en los comienzos era un reto, porque la mayoría de la gente no tenía acceso al hardware usado para ejecutar las herramientas originales. Los editores no oficiales eran primitivos y cambiaban constantemente. No existían funcionalidades básicas como la previsualización en 3D o los ajustes de texturas. Todo se hacía manualmente, editando los mapas originales y esperando a que terminasen largos procesos de compilación para poder ver el resultado. Beyond Belief se creó en siete meses y es una auténtica demostración del tiempo y la frustración que requería perfeccionar un episodio en aquellos tiempos. Pero esto no impidió que Beyond Belief fuese publicado menos de un año después del lanzamiento de Quake. El legado de este episodio aún perdura hoy en día, ya que está considerado por la comunidad como uno de los complementos esenciales para el juego. Este lanzamiento de Beyond Belief también incluye Beyond Belief 2008, un mapa de secuela creado por Matthias Worch y Negke.

Beyond Belief — это один из ранних примеров профессионально сделанных игровых уровней для Quake. Матиас Ворх создал Beyond Belief в середине 1990-х. Это набор из восьми уровней, которые легко могли бы официально войти в пятый эпизод — даже в своем изначальном виде. Редактировать Quake в те годы было непросто, потому что у большинства не было доступа к достаточно мощным для этого компьютерам. Сторонние редакторы все время менялись и были примитивны: в них не было базового функционала, например предварительного просмотра в 3D или настройки текстур. Все это приходилось делать вручную на картах самой игры, а затем ждать, пока закончится долгая компиляция. Beyond Belief создавалась семь месяцев — и это показывает, сколько времени и нервов уходило на один эпизод. Тем не менее, модификация вышла в один год с самой игрой — и популярна до сих пор (в сообществе Quake этот эпизод рассматривают как одно из важнейших дополнений). В эту версию Beyond Belief также входит Beyond Belief 2008 — продолжение, созданное Матиасом Ворхом и Negke. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game bbelief”.

Contract Revoked is a COOP-friendly episode consisting of four levels. As a slipgate warrior of great experience, you are the veteran of countless battles in the dusty worlds that lie scattered throughout the universe. In a lifespan measured only by the accumulation of victories, you have made friend and foe of the strangest creatures. Unbound by such futile concepts as good and evil, the last allegiance you gave was with the monstrous entity known in the human languages as “Cthon”. A contract, inscribed on daemon hide and signed in your own blood, has bound your life to Cthon. The awesome power and insight of this fearsome servitor of the “Great Old Ones” has served you well in time, but now the day has come for Cthon to collect on this bloody pact. The contract is sealed in a library of the ancient outer worlds, amidst a city of hostile creatures. You hurl yourself through a slipgate to seek this contract and ensure your release. If successful, you will be freed of obligation; if not, you will be freed of life. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game contract”.

Deathmatch Dimension is an episode of ten maps inspired by Quake’s deathmatch set for singleplayer with COOP and deathmatch support. You take control of Dave who had longed for nothing but to paint for his whole life. Painting was the only reason Dave worked at Outpost Stanley, a small and secluded military installation in the Colorado mountains. His propensity for high levels of controlled violence meant that his career was either the military, riot police, or perhaps substitute teacher if he wanted to fund his artistic endeavors. Outpost Stanley's commanding officer encouraged everybody to attend chapel on a Sunday. The marines had refurbished a beautiful old building in a nearby ghost town and were using that for services. However, something had apparently happened at the chapel that resulted in the deaths of several marines, and now Dave, despite being a janitor, was being sent to investigate. Even though a portal to the Netherworld likely had been opened somewhere in or around the chapel, Dave thought it would be a great chance to practice perspective drawing and do some small studies of the stained glass windows. He grabbed a shotgun, 25 shells, an axe, his watercolours, and a sketchbook. Now fully geared, Dave then set out along the cliff toward the chapel to investigate. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game dmd”.

Even though a portal to the Netherworld likely had been opened somewhere in or around the chapel, Dave thought it would be a great chance to practice perspective drawing and do some small studies of the stained glass windows. He grabbed a shotgun, 25 shells, an axe, his watercolours, and a sketchbook. Now fully geared, Dave then set out along the cliff toward the chapel to investigate. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game dmd”.

Deathmatch Dimension is an episode of ten maps inspired by Quake’s deathmatch set for singleplayer with COOP and deathmatch support. You take control of Dave who had longed for nothing but to paint for his whole life. Painting was the only reason Dave worked at Outpost Stanley, a small and secluded military installation in the Colorado mountains. His propensity for high levels of controlled violence meant that his career was either the military, riot police, or perhaps substitute teacher if he wanted to fund his artistic endeavors.

Vor dir liegt ein verlassenes Dorf und eine riesige Kirche, die düster in den Himmel ragt. Die Bewohner scheinen schon länger verschwunden zu sein, aber warum? Wenn du es wissen willst, solltest du dich in die Kirche und ihre Katakomben wagen. Honey ist ein Add-on aus zwei Karten von Christian Grawert, Senior Level Designer bei MachineGames und einer der namhaftesten Quake-Kartendesigner, der dem einen oder anderen vielleicht unter dem Pseudonym czg ein Begriff ist. Honey wurde 2012 veröffentlicht und erfreute sich sofort großer Beliebtheit bei der Quake-Community. Es fand sich sogar das ein ums andere Mal auf Best-of-Listen wieder. Honey bleibt dem klassischen Quake-Rezept weitgehend treu, würzt das Ganze aber auch auf seine eigene süßliche Art: So kann man Zombies mit Äxten malträtieren, wenn es einem an Raketen mangelt, und einige Türen werden nun durch Sprengstoff gesichert, also Vorsicht! Honey ist ein Must-Play mit spannendem Finale, das man nicht verpassen möchte. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game honey”.

An old, abandoned village lies in front of you, and a large church looms overhead. It appears to have been empty for quite some time, but what caused this? Enter the church and its depths below and find out in Honey, a two map addon by Christian Grawert, a senior level designer at MachineGames, and one of the most renowed Quake mappers under the alias czg. Released in 2012, Honey was an instant hit, and is often seen on best of lists in the Quake community. Honey stays close to the original Quake formula, but allows zombies to be chopped up with the axe, introducing a new way to kill them if you are lacking in rockets. Certain doors are now also gated by explosives, which creates an interesting twist in progression. Honey is definitely a must play, and be sure to stick around after for the thrilling conclusion! To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game honey”.

Sandman, the bringer of dreams, has been absent for a long while now. At first none of us noticed, because dreams often go unremembered. The nights were empty, but then the visions showed up. Visions from another world, a world of terror and vileness, a world where the creations from nightmares are all gathered up waiting for a soul to destroy with fear. Those who cannot wake up in time are reduced to just a breathing shell of a human, nothing left but the occasional twitch here and there. Some believe it is the end of times and some believe it is aliens. All of us know though, that it can’t last for much longer. Nobody has slept for god knows how long, living in constant fear of even yawning, in fear of the terrors that have taken Sandman’s place. There are limits for both the human psyche and body, and one day those limits will break us, throwing perhaps the whole of humanity into a coma. But we still hope that one day, someone will have enough courage to face their fears, and if possible, bring Sandman back to us. Please, if you think you can do what we all have failed, at least try to save our minds. They’re trapped in dreamland, come find them there...

Please, if you think you can do what we all have failed, at least try to save our minds. They’re trapped in dreamland, come find them there... To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game insomnia”.

“Quake never stops trying” you mutter the words savagely as you pace the floor of the Emergency Command Bunker; the last bastion of what was Frater Research Base. As the base commander, you saw Frater grow into a facility playing host to some scientist types. What was in their mysterious building? You don't know. But Quake wants it, and wants it badly. You've some suspicions yourself - like illegal slipgate research - or maybe something to do with the strange behavior of Doctor Ernst “Hat” Hattenschweiller's “patients”. Other little peculiarities began to crop up. Missing supplies, for one; odd power demands from various parts of the base, and especially from that building. However, the final straw came from Hat himself. He sent an emergency call - the patients were starting to overrun the facility. A flash of wrong coloured light from outside drew you to the window. It was that building, being struck by lightning coming down from a gangrenous, unearthly sky. It's only a matter of time before they break down the doors and take you down as well... You plan your route to Hat’s laboratory - where things seemed to begin - and one more to check and load your gun. Quake never stops trying, you say to yourself, and neither will you… Fight through five maps as you defend your world against horrors from beyond. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game oum”. This does not support the enhanced models and will turn them off automatically.

Sorti en 2021, The Punishment Due est un épisode à cinq cartes basé sur les thèmes bien connus de Quake et qui comprend une nouvelle bande originale créée par Juzley & Alekswithak. Conçu à partir de Copper, un addon d'ajustement de gameplay, The Punishment Due s'attache à créer un épisode moderne qui n'est pas sans rappeler le jeu original. Le premier niveau, Azure Annoyance, commence par nous offrir une architecture gothique traditionnelle en briques, mais s'ouvre ensuite sur un système de grottes tentaculaire, créant ainsi un nouveau style à la croisée de la brique et de la roche. L'action se poursuit jusqu'à la quatrième carte, With Fiends Like These, un château labyrinthique avec plus de 300 ennemis. Sauvegardez vite et sauvegardez souvent ! Les auteurs Juzley et Fairweather nous prouvent ici que la communauté Quake est toujours en pleine expansion même après 25 ans, n'ayant commencé à faire des niveaux pour le jeu Quake d'origine qu'en 2019. The Punishment Due est sans aucun doute un bel exemple de la qualité du style et de l'élégance du gameplay de la communauté moderne de créateurs et créatrices de cartes pour Quake. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game pun”.

Pubblicato nel 2021, The Punishment Due è un episodio di cinque mappe che utilizza i temi autentici di Quake e presenta una nuova colonna sonora originale a opera di Juzley & Alekswithak. Basato sull'add-on Copper, che rivisita il gameplay, The Punishment Due ambisce a creare un episodio attuale che ricorda il gioco originale. Il primo livello, Azure Annoyance, inizia con una tradizionale ambientazione gotica di mattoni, ma si apre in un vasto sistema di grotte. Questo mix di mattoni e roccia produce un nuovo stile. L'azione si intensifica nella quarta mappa, With Fiends Like These, un castello labirintico con più di 300 nemici. Salva in anticipo e salva spesso! Gli autori Juzley e Fairweather dimostrano che la community di Quake è ancora vivace dopo 25 anni, considerato che non hanno creato livelli per il Quake originale fino al 2019. The Punishment Due è sicuramente un ottimo esempio della qualità dello stile e del gameplay raffinato dell'attuale community di mapping di Quake. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game pun”.

The Punishment Due wurde 2021 veröffentlicht und ist eine fünf Maps umfassende Episode, die sich auf bewährte Quake-Themen stützt und mit einem neuen Original Soundtrack von Juzley & Alekswithak ausgestattet ist. Auf Basis des Copper-Gameplay-Add-ons wird mit The Punishment Due eine Episode inszeniert, die zwar modern ist, aber trotzdem an des Originalspiel erinnert. Das erste Level, „Azure Annoyance“, beginnt mit traditionellem gothischem Mauerwerk, geht dann aber in ein ausgedehntes Höhlensystem über, wo eine Mixtur aus Ziegeln und Stein einen ganz neuen Stil erschaffen. Die Action eskaliert bis zur vierten Map, „With Fiends Like These“ - einer weitläufigen Burg mit über 300 Gegnern. Nicht vergessen, regelmäßig zu speichern! Die Creator Juzley und Fairweather sind der Beweis dafür, dass die Quake-Community auch nach 25 Jahren immer noch floriert: Beide haben erst 2019 angefangen, Level für das originale Quake zu entwickeln. The Punishment Due ist ein echtes Paradebeispiel für die stilvolle Qualität und das feine Gameplay, durch die sich die moderne Quake-Mapping-Community auszeichnet. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game pun”.

Released in 2021, The Punishment Due is a five map episode using the tried and true Quake themes, and features a new original soundtrack by Juzley & Alekswithak. Built on top of the Copper gameplay adjustment addon, The Punishment Due sticks to creating a modern episode that is still reminiscent of the original game. The first level, Azure Annoyance, starts off with traditional gothic brick work, but opens up into a sprawling cave system, the mixture between brick and rock creating a new style. The action escalates to the fourth map, With Fiends Like These, a sprawling castle with over 300 enemies. Save early, and save often! Authors Juzley and Fairweather show that the Quake community is still growing after 25 years, not having started making levels for the original Quake until 2019. The Punishment Due is definitely a prime example of the quality style, and refined gameplay of the modern Quake mapping community. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game pun”.

The Punishment Due, publicado en 2021, es un episodio de cinco mapas con las temáticas habituales de Quake y que incluye una banda sonora original a cargo de Juzley & Alekswithak. Construido sobre el complemento de refinamiento de juego Copper, The Punishment Due nace con el objetivo de crear un episodio que sea fiel al juego original. El primer nivel, Azure Annoyance, comienza en el tradicional entorno gótico, pero se extiende por un vasto sistema de cuevas en el que la mezcla entre ladrillo y roca crea un nuevo estilo. La acción escala en el cuarto mapa, With Fiends Like These, un enorme castillo con más de 300 enemigos. ¡Guarda pronto y con frecuencia! Los autores, Juzley y Fairweather, demuestran que la comunidad de Quake sigue creciendo tras 25 años, ya que no empezaron a diseñar niveles para el juego original hasta 2019. The Punishment Due es sin duda un ejemplo perfecto de la calidad y el estilo de la comunidad moderna de Quake. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game pun”.

Эпизод The Punishment Due вышел в 2021 году и включает 5 карт, использующих классические темы Quake, с новым оригинальным саундтреком от Juzley & Alekswithak. Взяв за основу дополнение Copper, которое вносит изменения в игровой процесс, авторы The Punishment Due сделали современный эпизод, пронизанный духом оригинальной игры. Первый уровень Azure Annoyance встречает привычной готической кирпичной кладкой, но затем переходит в огромную систему пещер, где сочетание камня и кирпича порождает новый стиль. Масштаб достигает размаха на четвертом уровне With Fiends Like These, где игроки увидят колоссальный замок с более чем 300 врагами. Сохраняйтесь как можно раньше и чаще! Авторы дополнения Juzley и Fairweather доказывают, что сообщество Quake продолжает расти даже через 25 лет после выхода оригинальной Quake, ведь они создают для него карты лишь с 2019 года. The Punishment Due - яркий пример отточенного стиля и великолепного игрового процесса, создаваемого современными разработчиками модификаций для Quake.

DOOM a été porté sur de nombreuses plateformes depuis sa sortie, mais Quake n'a été porté que deux fois, à cause de ses configurations système requises plus exigeantes. L'un de ces deux portages était sur une console 32-bit, et l'autre était Quake 64. Si les deux portages offrent des versions modifiées des niveaux d'origine afin de fonctionner sur le matériel de l'époque, Quake 64 apportait des changements qui l'ont différencié de l'original de 1996. Les lumières colorées, une nouvelle bande-son par le compositeur reconnu Aubrey Hodges, et le multijoueur à deux en écran scindé étaient spécifiques à cette version du jeu. La nature unique de Quake 64 fait qu'il a pris une place importante dans les souvenirs des joueurs au fil du temps, et c'est pourquoi nous sommes ravis de pouvoir l'apporter dans notre époque moderne, avec la bande-son d'origine intacte.

Mentre DOOM è stato convertito per tante piattaforme da quando è uscito, Quake ha visto solo due porting a causa dei requisiti di sistema sensibilmente più alti: uno era per una console a 32 bit, mentre l'altro era Quake 64. Entrambi includevano versioni modificate dei livelli di gioco originali, necessari per funzionare sull'hardware dell'epoca, ma Quake 64 includeva anche alcune modifiche strutturali rispetto alla versione del 1996. Illuminazioni cromatiche, una nuova colonna sonora del celebre compositore Aubrey Hodges e una modalità multigiocatore a schermo condiviso furono tutte peculiarità di questa versione del gioco. L'unicità di Quake 64 lo ha reso oggetto di nostalgia da parte di molti giocatori nel corso degli anni ed è per questo che siamo lieti di portare il titolo nel presente, mantenendone intatta la colonna sonora originale.

DOOM wurde bereits auf viele Plattformen portiert - Quake hingegen nur auf zwei, was den viel höheren Systemanforderungen geschuldet ist: ein Port war auf eine 32-Bit-Konsole und ein anderer war Quake 64. Beide Ports beinhalteten modifizierte Versionen der ursprünglichen Level, um auf der damaligen Hardware auch laufen zu können. Quake 64 wartete zudem mit ein paar weiteren Änderungen zur ursprünglichen Veröffentlichung von 1996 auf, darunter farbiges Licht, ein brandneuer Soundtrack vom gefeierten Komponisten Aubrey Hodges sowie ein Splitscreen für den Multiplayer. Das hat Quake 64 einzigartig gemacht, und auf diese Einzigartigkeit schauen einige Spieler gerne zurück - und deshalb freut es uns, den Einzug von Quake 64 in die Moderne zu feiern, samt Original Soundtrack!

While DOOM was ported to many platforms throughout its lifetime, Quake only saw two ports due to its much higher system requirements. One of those ports was to a 32-bit console, and the other was Quake 64. While both ports featured modified versions of the original levels in order to run on the hardware at the time, Quake 64 featured a few changes that differentiated itself from the original 1996 release. Colored lighting, a brand new soundtrack by acclaimed composer Aubrey Hodges, and two player split screen multiplayer were all unique to this version of the game. The unique nature of Quake 64 has caused it to be looked back on fondly by some players over the years, which is why we are happy to be able to bring it into modern times, with the original soundtrack intact.

Aunque DOOM fue adaptado a muchas plataformas a lo largo de los años, Quake solo se adaptó en dos ocasiones debido a que sus requisitos del sistema eran muy superiores. Una de estas versiones fue para una consola de 32 bits, mientras que la otra fue Quake 64. Aunque ambas versiones incluían modificaciones a los niveles originales para que pudiesen ejecutarse en los sistemas de la época, Quake 64 contaba con otros cambios que lo diferenciaban del título original de 1996. La iluminación coloreada, la nueva banda sonora a cargo del aclamado compositor Aubrey Hodges y el multijugador a pantalla partida para dos jugadores eran todos exclusivos de esta versión del juego.

В свое время DOOM был портирован на множество платформ, а вот для Quake из-за высоких системных требований существует всего два порта. Первый — для 32-битной консоли, второй — Quake 64. Обе версии включали переработанные оригинальные уровни, рассчитанные на актуальные для тех времен аппаратные мощности, но в Quake 64 были внесены и другие изменения, которые отличают эту версию от оригинальной версии 1996 года. К ним относятся цветное освещение, новый саундтрек, написанный знаменитым композитором Обри Ходжесом, и многопользовательский режим с разделенным экраном для двух игроков. Уникальные особенности Quake 64 стали причиной того, что многие игроки по-прежнему любят и помнят эту игру. Именно поэтому мы решили порадовать вас новой версией Quake 64 с оригинальным саундтреком.

Rubicon 2 est un épisode composé de trois cartes sorti en 2011 et créé par le duo de moddeurs “metlslime” et “czg”. La collaboration des deux vétérans de la communauté de Quake, à qui l'on doit plusieurs ports sources et sites Internet, ainsi que d'innombrables cartes, a donné naissance à Rubicon 2. En adoptant une approche plus industrielle et futuriste pour les cartes, Rubicon 2 exploite totalement le thème de base de Quake, mais arbore également un aspect distinct grâce à l'utilisation de nouvelles textures. Les nouveaux ennemis de Rubicon 2 constituent l'un des ajouts majeurs du jeu. Tandis que le premier opus se limitait aux grunts, aux exécuteurs et aux chiens, Rubicon 2 voit son bestiaire s'agrandir avec l'arrivée de plusieurs ennemis propres à l'univers : le dreadnaught avec son lance-flammes dévastateur à bout portant, les centurions qui tirent des clous depuis une plate-forme volante et les automates qui explosent une fois tués. De nouveaux éléments de gameplay font également leur apparition, comme les échelles, les bouches d'aération et les lasers, un premier exemple de la façon dont les extensions en mode solo peuvent améliorer le gameplay initial de Quake grâce à quelques ajouts judicieux. Rubicon 2 a connu un grand succès depuis sa sortie, devenant une extension incontournable pour la communauté. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game rubicon2”.

Rubicon 2 è un episodio di tre mappe pubblicato nel 2011 dal duo metlslime-czg. Entrambi veterani di lungo corso nella community di Quake, con all'attivo port sorgente, siti web e innumerevoli mappe, dalla loro collaborazione è nato Rubicon 2. Con un approccio alle mappe più fantascientifico e industriale, Rubicon 2 fa ampio uso del tema base di Quake, ma donandogli un aspetto unico grazie all'impiego di nuove texture. L'aggiunta più importante a Rubicon 2 sono i nuovi nemici. Mentre la prima edizione si limitava a grunt, esecutori e cani, Rubicon 2 allarga il bestiario con nuovi avversari che rispecchiano un tema: il Dreadnought armato di lanciafiamme e letale a distanza ravvicinata, i centurioni che sparano chiodi da una piattaforma volante, gli automi che esplodono in punto di morte. Sono inoltre presenti alcuni nuovi elementi del gameplay, con l'aggiunta di scale, sfiati per il vapore e laser: un precoce esempio di come gli add-on per giocatore singolo possono ampliare la classica esperienza di Quake tramite novità intelligenti. Rubicon 2 è stato molto apprezzato sin dalla sua pubblicazione, diventando uno degli add-on stabilmente presenti tra i consigli della community. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game rubicon2”.

„Rubicon 2“ ist eine Episode mit drei Maps, die 2011 von metlslime und czg veröffentlicht wurde. Bei den beiden handelt es sich um Langzeit-Veteranen der Quake-Community, die schon einige Source-Ports, Webseiten und eine Menge Maps auf dem Buckel haben und sich für „Rubicon 2“ zusammengetan haben. Die Maps dieses Add-ons stützen sich auf die bekannte Quake-Formel, geben dem Ganzen aber einen etwas industrielleren, Sci-Fi-artigen Anstrich. Neben dem einzigartigen Look sticht aber noch etwas hervor: neue Gegner. Der erste Release beschränkte sich auf Grunt, Enforcer und ein paar Hunde, während „Rubicon 2“ die Riege um zwei thematisch sehr passende Gegner erweitert: einen Dreadnaught, der mit seinem Flammenwerfer auf naher Distanz sehr gefährlich werden kann, die Centurion, die von fliegenden Plattformen aus Geschosse auf einen abfeuern, sowie Automatons, die beim Tod explodieren. Außerdem gibt es neue Gameplay- und Map-Elemente wie Leitern, Schächte und natürlich Laser - ein perfektes Beispiel dafür, wie Singleplayer-Add-ons das klassische Quake-Gameplay sinnvoll erweitern können. „Rubicon 2“ hat bereits eine Menge Lob eingefahren und ist nicht umsonst eine Must-have-Empfehlung der Community. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game rubicon2”.

Rubicon 2 is a three map episode released in 2011 by the duo of metlslime and czg. Both longtime veterans of the Quake community, with source ports, websites, and countless maps under their belt, Rubicon 2 would come about as a result of their collaboration. Taking a more sci-fi and industrial approach to the maps, Rubicon 2 makes heavy use of the base Quake theme, but its use of new textures creates a distinct look for itself. The most notable addition in Rubicon 2 is the new enemies. While the first release was limited to the grunt, enforcer, and dogs, Rubicon 2 extends the bestiary with new thematically appropriate opponents: the flamethrower-wielding Dreadnaught is lethal at close range, the Centurions who will shoot nails from a flying platform, and Automatons who will detonate on death. Some new gameplay elements are also present, with the addition of ladders, steam vents, and lasers, an early example of how single player add-ons can extend the classic Quake gameplay with some sensible additions. Rubicon 2 has been highly regarded since release, becoming one of the essential add-ons in community recommendations. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game rubicon2”.

También aparecen nuevos elementos como escaleras, respiraderos de vapor y láseres; un gran ejemplo de cómo los complementos para Un jugador pueden ampliar la jugabilidad clásica de Quake con incorporaciones sutiles.

Rubicon 2 - эпизод из трёх карт, выпущенный в 2011 году дуэтом metlslime и czg. Эти ветераны сообщества Quake работали над исходными портами и сайтами - они создали великое множество карт. Rubicon 2 стал итогом их совместного творчества. Сочетая научно-фантастический и промышленный стили, Rubicon 2 активно использует основную тематику Quake, а за счет новых текстур позволяет посмотреть на игру под новым углом. Одним из главных нововведений Rubicon 2 стали новые противники. Первая версия использовала только солдат, силовиков и собак. Rubicon 2 расширил бестиарий, добавив туда подходящих по тематике врагов. Вооружённый огнемётом дредноут смертельно опасен в ближнем бою, центурионы стреляют гвоздями с летающей платформы, а механизмы взрываются при уничтожении. Появились и новые элементы игрового процесса: лестницы, паросбросные клапаны и лазеры. Это один из ранних примеров того, как дополнения для одиночной игры расширяют классический игровой процесс Quake благодаря продуманным нововведениям. Rubicon 2 был тепло принят публикой, а участники сообщества активно рекомендуют его и поныне. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game rubicon2”.

Terra est une collection de huit niveaux créés par Christian Grawert, Senior Level Designer chez MachineGames, connu de la communauté Quake sous le nom de czg. Bien qu'elle ait sept ans de plus que son autre extension célèbre, Honey, Terra offre le même design de niveau intelligent que ses autres publications. Inspirée par le combat de DOOM, Terra apporte des combats dans des espaces réduits conçus autour des placements d'ennemis, dans des espaces plus abstraits centrés sur le gameplay plutôt que la création d'espaces réalistes. Les pièces se replient sur elles-mêmes de façon intéressante, ouvrant la progression et créant des opportunités de combat à différents angles. Cette publication apporte aussi des nouveautés : deux nouveaux niveaux, y compris une conclusion, ainsi que de nombreux changements et améliorations pour tous ceux qui ont joué à la version originale. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game terra”.

Terra è una serie di otto livelli creata da Christian Grawert, progettista di livelli senior di MachineGames noto nella community di Quake come czg. Nonostante abbia sette anni in più di Honey, altro suo add-on in evidenza, Terra vanta lo stesso level design di grande impatto. Ispirato ai combattimenti di DOOM, Terra propone scontri in ambienti angusti e progettati in base alla disposizione dei nemici, nonché in ambienti astratti e imperniati più sul gameplay che sul realismo dei luoghi. Le stanze si ripresentano in modi interessanti favorendo la progressione e creando opportunità di combattimento da varie angolazioni. Tra le novità di questa versione sono inclusi due livelli aggiuntivi, tra cui uno finale, e svariate modifiche pensate per chiunque abbia giocato alla versione originale.

Terra besteht aus acht Leveln, die von czg alias Christian Grawert, seines Zeichens Senior Level Designer bei MachineGames, kreiert wurden. Zwar ist dieses Add-on um etwa sieben Jahre älter als sein anderes Werk, Honey, hängt in puncto smartes Level-Design aber keinesfalls hinterher. Terra hat sich Inspiration von DOOM geholt: Die Kämpfe finden auf engem Raum statt, die wiederum in Gegner-Bereichen angelegt sind, die gekonnt Gameplay und eine etwas realistischere Umgebung verbinden. Man kommt auf interessanten Wegen zurück in bekannte Räume, sodass sich neue Herangehensweisen an Kämpfe eröffnen. Für diesen Release wurden zwei neue Level hinzugefügt, darunter das Finale, und eine Reihe von Verbesserungen und Optimierungen implementiert, sodass auch Spieler des alten Releases was davon haben.

Terra is a set of eight levels created by Christian Grawert, senior level designer at MachineGames, known in the Quake community as czg. Despite being seven years older than his other featured add-on, Honey, Terra delivers on the same smart level design as his other releases. Inspired by the combat in DOOM, Terra has fights taking place in tight spaces designed around enemy layouts in more abstract spaces designed around gameplay versus creating more realistic spaces. Rooms wind back in on themselves in interesting ways, opening up progression and creating combat opportunities at different angles. New to this release are two extra levels, including a finale, along with many changes and tweaks along the way for anyone who played the original release.

Terra — коллекция из восьми уровней, созданных Кристианом Гровертом, старшим дизайнером уровней из студии MachineGames, который известен в сообществе Quake под псевдонимом czg. Несмотря на то, что он выпустил Terra на семь лет раньше, чем Honey, вы вновь насладитесь его остроумным подходом к созданию уровней. Сражения в Terra напоминают о классическом DOOM; вас ждут битвы в абстрактных тесных пространствах, создавая которые, автор пожертвовал реализмом в пользу игрового процесса. Помещения замыкаются сами на себя оригинальными способами, открывая дальнейшие пути и создавая неожиданные боевые ситуации. Новинкой дополнения стали два дополнительных уровня, включая финальный, а также множество изменений и исправлений, которые наверняка понравятся тем, кто играл в его оригинальную версию. To play in multiplayer, first start a multiplayer match, then open the console with the ` key, and then enter “game terra”.

Underdark Overbright es un episodio de ocho niveles que combina temáticas medievales y entornos cubiertos de maleza, para ofrecernos uno de los mejores ejemplos de un mod moderno creado por la comunidad de Quake. Consta de dos partes: el episodio para un solo jugador y el mod de Copper, que incluye una lista de cambios más que interesantes en pro del equilibrio. El nuevo episodio ofrece momentos realmente memorables, como una batalla submarina, un combate a muerte sobre unas plataformas que se van hundiendo en un lecho de lava y una serie de nuevas versiones para un solo jugador de clásicos del modo Partida a muerte. Los cambios de Copper en los sistemas de juego afectan a los comportamientos de distintas armas, el de los enemigos e incluso a algunas de las normas del cooperativo. Con ellos, los sistemas de Quake adquieren mucha más cohesión, aparte de que es una forma estupenda de volver a vivir la campaña. Además, se puede acceder a los episodios originales de Quake (y a uno totalmente nuevo) desde el mapa de Underdark Overbright. ¡Vamos, que no os lo podéis perder!
